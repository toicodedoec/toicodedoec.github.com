1. React-Native is a framework, ReactJS is a JS library you can use for your website.

2. React-Native requires Xcode (for iOS) or Android Studio (for Android), ReactJS requires only web browser.

3. React-Native doesn't use HTML to render the app, but using components that map the actual real native iOS or Android UI components that get rendered on the app, meanwhile ReactJS uses HTML/CSS like as the traditional web apps.

3.1. Because your code doesn’t get rendered in an HTML page, this also means you won’t be able to reuse any libraries you previously used with ReactJS that renders any kind of HTML, SVG or Canvas.

3.2. To style your React-Native components, you will have to create stylesheets in Javascript. It looks similar to CSS, but it’s not exactly the same. Then you understand React-Native is not made from web elements and can’t be styled in the same way.

4. Navigation in React-Native is done by the Navigator built-in component, meanwhile we can use react-router library for this purpose in React.

5. The beauty of working with React-Native is also the ability to use most developer tools you use with ReactJS.
